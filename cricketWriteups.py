sixWriteups = ["Pumps it over deep midwcket! The length ball gets figured out","Pulled over wide long-on! The batter points to the dugout, then turns around and underlines his name on the jersey. ","Swiped over deep square! Doesn't dare go to the yorker  and it has costed him big. This is a length ball on leg stump. The Batter stays tall and swipes under that. It's all there - the pace, the line, the length. His job was to make contact. And he did. The bowler pulls his shirt up and sinks his face into it","Upper cut over the cover boundary. You read that right. Some hit, this. Short and wide outside off and sitting up for him. He reaches out and sends it well in front of square","Pumps it over the long leg boundary! Slower short ball down leg side. Waits on that and pulls from under it. Sends it onto the second tier","Punched over the long-off boundary off the back foot! Or a back foot position, anyway. That is outrageous. Technically, he's running down at that, but he's static as he forces this short of a length ball. Straight bat but down to up, a punch upwards and it's gone a fair distance too. Incredible","Doesn't stay low this time and he uses the bounce to lift this over the long leg boundary. Short and into middle and off. Swivels and nails the pick up","Drilled straight! The bowler is rattled. Looks like this quicker one is pushed through from the front of the hand. It's overpitched and outside off and it's the perfect pace as he drives straight and through the line","Steps out and drags it over square leg! Good length and dipping on him as he steps out. He counts on it to spin into his body and it does, and his wholehearted slog makes connection","Front leg out of the way for the slog sweep. Good length and at a middle stump line. Down on one knee and that slides on nicely as he swings from underneath","Clears long-on. Full on leg stump, in his swining arc and he manages to get just enough bat on the lofted drive","Swung over the midwicket boundary. Good length on middle stump, confident in the forward stride this time and a clean swing on it","Looks like the wrong'un to me but either way it is too full. The batter clears the front leg and lofts him hard back over his head. Excellent intent","On-pace full ball, batter is quick to go across, bend his back knee onto the ground and ramp this over the keeper's head for a six. Incredible shot. This is death overs already the way he is batting","Slower ball, 114ks, but it doesn't matter to the batter who extends his arms through this length ball and goes straight back over his head. Looks a little like Brad Haddin in executing this shot","Flat-batted over the long-off boundary! Whew, they sound sweet when he connects. Short of a length and rising outside off. Gets half a stride on the front foot and hammers that","Swept over square leg! Good length ball in at middle and off. He gets on one knee and pulls out one of the cleanest sweeps, right off the middle","Pulls it over the midwicket boundary. Short of a length at middle stump, rising up at the hips and he gets his weight onto the front foot as he pulls","Just over deep midwicket. High full toss swerving in at middle stump. On the front foot again and with swinging room. Comes off the high part of the bat but there's enough pace on that","Sweet sound on the pull over midwicket. Short of a length and just outside off. Backs away and times it perfectly. Picks his spot well too. There's no one back on the boundary and this dips into the boundary padding on the full","Length outside off, leans in and sweeps aerially to the midwicket boundary","Launched it over wide long-on! Short of a length and at middle stump again. This time he doesn't defend - makes room instead and takes him on with the pull and nails the connection this time","Stays still this time and uses the angle to swipe this over square leg. Good length and onto leg stump. Got the front leg across and swept from under that","And the batter celebrates this performance with a six. Again the bowler misses his yorker mark by a few inches, and this time he goes to his favourite area: over midwicket","Oh he looks like Gayle at his best. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this ball except that it is bowled to the Universe Boss impersonator. Short of a length, rib-high, 140-plus ks, and still he punches this over mid-off for a six. That is extraordinary!","Gets one in his slot, well in his slot, and the Batter depostis this leg-side half-volley over wide long-on. Such smart batting. Nothing to do with length balls, and take toll of the full ones","He is going to take the risk with the googly, look to buy the wicket, but again just a touch too full. The batter knows he can clear this field with a mis-hit if this is in his zone. And this is not sweetly hit, and yet the skier clears long-off with ease"]
fourWriteups = ["Outside edge to third man.","Dragged to the fine leg boundary. A full toss on the pads. Stands tall and gets it fine of the short fine fielder","Manages to get the sweep away this time. This guy sees differently. Gets down on a knee and drags a Lockie Ferguson length ball over square leg from outside off","Beats deep midwicket's slide. Short of a length slower ball, steps out and pulls between long-on, and deep midwicket. They're converging on that and deep midwicket almost pulls out of the slide at the end","Shuffles and swipes it fine. Expert limited-overs batting. He's played pretty much the only two boundary shots you can get off these length balls outside off. It's angled in, he uses that to get it fine","Rolls into the long-off boundary. Mid-off is in. He steps out in anticipation of the bowler's good length ball slammed into the pitch and gets it. Outside off, he's running into the leg side. It comes off the low part of the bat and floats over the infield","Cut over extra cover. Drops this legbreak short outside off, he's backing into the leg side as he whips out at it. Fielder slides to his right, studs up like a red-card tackle. Can't stop that","Full and wide again, and he lifts it over extra cover like the throwdown it is","Lofts it straight! This is fairly simple batting for the batter who is very good against spin. There's dew, Bowler doesn't give it too may revs. So he knows it's safe to run down at him without the fear of getting beaten. Doesn't get to the pitch of this length ball but manages to launch it anyway","Gorgeous lofted drive over the bowler. Full and into off stump, stays very still and offers the full face to get this over the bowler. Minimum effort","Lifted over extra cover. Full and just outside off, half a stride but out of the way of the ball to make room. Goes inside-out from right under his eyes","Spanked to long-off's right. That's a good looking drive. Good length and sliding on quickly outside off, goes through the line and on the rise","Misfielded at point. Bowler fires this in short, Batter cuts it in air, dying in front of Fielder at point. Fielder goes for the catch and dives forward, and he reaches it too. But the hands come down late, and it squeezes under them","Slower ball, short of a length, and just slides down too much, and batter pulls this square of long leg for four","Slider, on a length, and he goes back to cut it late and cut it powerfully. He has also placed this in front of deep cover","This is an even better sweep. A tall man playing sweeps efficiently. This time is the reverse variety. It has the keeper excited because he has taken this from in front of the wicket and really full. Places this to the left of short third man","Makes room to take this length ball and drive it over cover for four. ","Pumped past the bowler. Slower ball at a length wide outside off, slides on nicely as he gets forward. Slapped on the rise ad long-off has no chance to the left","Past the keeper. Good length and onto the pads. Gets forward for the flick and it defects off the thigh guard","Past backward point's jump. Full and wide outside off. Reaches out and chops at that. FIelder stretches high to his left with both hands and only manages a fingertip on it","Pummeled past mid-off. Full slower ball outside off. Waits with a forward and stride and swings powerfully though the line","Dropped short and wide outside off, waits on that and cuts it past backward point","Chipped wide of mid-on. Full inswinger onto leg stump. Half a stride out and meets it on the pitch before whipping the wrists at it","Hammered past the bowler. Loves the straight drives. This one is in the slot, just outside off, he half-steps into the leg side and gets it into the straight boundary, all along the ground","Slapped over extra cover. Good length and pushed wide outside off. Front leg in the leg side, arms reaching way outside off and lifted on the rise","Swatted to mid-on's right. Short and just outside off, goes horizontal bat and across the angle with the pull. It's not off the middle but there's enough","Punched wide of mid-off and beats his sprint too. Good length and into middle stump. Had to jump quickly into the leg side to make room, but did it well enough for the power into the punch"]
threeWriteups = ["Good length and pushed across him. Front leg into the leg side and slapped on the up to long-off's right","Nice timing on this but straight to sweeper cover. They steal a second from him. Short of a length outside off and a nice flow on the cover drive","Googly at a length on middle stump, steps out and is beaten in flight. Manages to jab it into the vacant leg side off the inside edge","Short of a length outside off, waits on that and cuts to sweeper's left","Short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper's left","Just short of deep midwicket and they pinch the second. Full slower ball at middle stump, gets down for the slog sweep and gets too far under it. Ends up lofting it high as the fielder swoops in on it","Full outside off, looks to drive through the off side and gets a thick inside edge to long-on's right","Slower short ball just outside off, cut aerially to sweeper's right","Slower ball at a length on middle stump, flicked to long-on's right","Slower ball at a length on middle stump, leans and in and clips it to short fine's left","Good length on leg stump, clipped to deep square's right off the front foot","Good length outside off, leans in and nudges to long-on's left with soft hands","Slower ball, he goes inside-out, and places this square of deep cover for two","Quick, straight, worked to deep midwicket for two","Short of a length, into the body, placed to the left of long leg for two","Again he plays the paddle sweep to the first ball from a new spinner. Both are quickish spinners. So he uses the pace to place this fine of fine leg","Lovely reverse sweep first ball. The length is a touch short for the shot, but he sweeps down on it, and drags from around leg. And keeps it down too. And beats short third man to his right","Yorker at leg stump, squeezed out towards long-on","Full and wide outside off, chucks the hands at this with a cover drive, thick outside edge to third man's right","Good length on leg stump, whipped to long-on's left off the back foot","Good length and into leg stump, uses the angle to deep square's left","Good length and just outside off, punched into the covers","Good length and into the pads. Uses the angle to flick this aerially over midwicket. Safely wide of deep square","Sliced over point. Length ball wide outside off and he opens the face to try and clear the covers off the front foot","Just clears cover. Length ball outside off, gets a stride out and looks to lift that over the infield on the up, but that comes off the toe end and plonks into the turf past the back-pedaling fielder","On a length, quick, angling across him, pushed between point and cover-point, and he comes back for two","But now he will amble through for a couple after dunking this length ball into a gap deep on the leg side"]
twoWriteups = ["Good length and pushed across him. Front leg into the leg side and slapped on the up to long-off's right","Nice timing on this but straight to sweeper cover.

oneWriteups = ["Good length and pushed wide across him again. Seems a plan and he's stuck to it so far. Batter looks to hammer it through the off side, gets an under-edge to extra cover","Yorker at a middle stump line, 146kph. Backs away and chops it to sweeper cover","Low full toss at leg stump, 145kph, whipped along the ground to deep midwicket who steams in and keeps them to one.","Yorker just outside off, front leg in the leg side and in the air. Balance entirely on his back foot. Can only stab it down to long-off","Full and just outside off, clears the front leg and drills it to long-off's left","Full and just outside off, forced down to long-on off the front foot","Can't get the run-out at the non-striker's end. It's a yorker outside off. Batter wants to ramp over short fine. Gets it pitch side on the leg side and is nowhere near completing the run. Cummins can't quite find the balance as he picks up and turns to throw","Inside edge on a good yorker. At leg stump. Batter backs away and has a hack at that. Out to short fine's right","Short and skiddy at middle stump. Hurried pull to deep midwicket","Good length outside off, leans in and punches to long-off on the front foot","Good length on leg stump, pulled to deep backward square","Good length at leg stump, miscued slog to deep midwicket","Another slower offcutter, slightly fuller, driven to deep cover for one","Short of a length, angling in, punched down to long-on for one","Short of a length, uses his height to get it chest high.

dotBallWriteups = ["Beaten on the slash. It's a length ball across the corridor.","Mistimed slog back to the bowler. Short of a length and just outside off. His pull is back to the bowler on the bounce","Beaten on the attempted ramp. Low full toss in the corridor. He predicted the length alright, but the line doesn't allow him to get bat on that because it's headed straight for him as he shuffles","Short of a length and across off stump. Beaten on the attempted late cut","Good length and turning away outside off, punched into the covers off the back foot","Good length and just outside off, steps out and pokes into the covers","Dropped! Oh he's going to think about this all evening if they don't pull it off tonight. A simple catch put down by the bowler in his follow through. Short of a length outside off. The batter runs down the pitch and isn't close to the pitch of that. Looks to punch towards long-off and it comes off the high part of the bat and floats at a comfortably pace and height to the bowler's right. He gets both hands on it, but perhaps the hands were too hard","Inside edge onto pad as this googly heads for middle stump from outside off","Beaten on the punch. Good length ball delivered with a legcutter grip. Most times that comes in. That's what the batter thinks on this occasion.But this grips and goes away","Good length and just outside off, defended to extra covet off the front foot","Good length and just outside off, opens the face and pushes to extra cover","Good length and just outside off, pushed to extra cover off the front foot","Just short of the diving man at point. This is short of a length, he looks to which this to leg, but gets an inside edge onto the thigh pad. fielder  puts in a full-length dive at point, but this still reaches him only on a half-volley","Skiddy quick ball just short of a length. Another dot. The perfect in-between length","Short of a length, quick, cramping him up. Defended back to him","Slower offcutter, 116ks, short of a length, and the turn beats him as he looks to open the face","Goes back to late-cut a slow legbreak, but can't beat point","Missed run-out chance as the ball slips out of Bowler's hand. A yorker at off stump, jammed pitch side on the off side. Batter takes off for a speculative run and is sent back. Bowler lost the ball just as he looks to release the throw","Short of a length on middle stump, defended off the back foot","Short and wide outside off, mistimed cut to cover's left","Good length outside off, walks into that punch into the covers","Good length and just outside off, punched into the covers","Short and wide outside off stump, punched straight to extra cover off the back foot","Short of a length and sliding into his body again as he looks to open up the covers with a punch","Good length and sliding into leg stump.

Short of a length and rising up in the corridor as he feels for it","Short of a length and curving away outside off, mistimed punch on the up"]
wicketWriteups = ["Splits middle and off stump! It's a length ball angled into the stumps. He drops his right shoulder and gets low to try and ramp this over short fine, but that has slid onto the stumps from under the bat. Shakes his head as he walks off","Takes out leg stump! Oh he's burst through the batter's defences after softening him up the last two balls. Proper dominance, those last three balls. This is quick, and it's sliding into the batter who is hurriedly skipping into the leg side to try and make room and stab this through square leg off the back foot. Plays all over it and the stump is well and truly tonked. ","Can't beat mid-off this time. Short and wide from the bowler this time. He runs down the pitch and wants to flat-bat it over the infield. But it's gotten too steep for control and it's about throat height for the fielder there","Taken at long-on. A tame slog sweep attempte. A hit out attempt. Wasn't picking him at all. A length ball outside off that grips and goes away from the attempted slog sweep. Sends it high up and it's taken well inside","Taken at long-off. Full slower ball wide outside off. Walks into the off side this time and is still forced to reach out. Wants to loft over extra cover but gets it only a couple of yards to long-off's right","Slammed high up and taken at long-on. Full offcutter at off stump. The batter looks for the slog and is done by the pace. Gets a nice connection on it but it's all elevation. And it looks like that swerves on the batter late in its path because he's taken it a couple of inches out to his right and at waist height. These guys train to take catches as close to the body as possible so that must have changed path. Good take to end a good innings","Top edge out to deep square. Good length ball gets big on him as he checks himself on the attempted sweep. Floats out gently for the fielder","Taken at deep midwicket. Tosses this up slowly at a middle and leg line. He's hitting into the longer side. And he can't clear the fielder with the slog. Floats nicely out to the fielder who takes it inisde the line","Knocks out leg stump and belts out a victory cry! Batter pretty static in his stance outside leg stump. Looks like he was trying to open up the off side. It's a slider on a good length, and he swishes for the initial line as it beats the inside edge","Sensational catch at mid-off. The fielder uses all his height to dive full-length and forward to send him back. The batter is looking for something pitched slightly full to go over mid-off, but this is bowled cross-seam and stops on him. It is dying on the fielder, but he flies forward to take this inches from the ground. One of the best catches of the season for sure","Slows it down, tempts the batsman, and he skips down to try to go for a straight six. The ball drift away a little, and is also slow in the air, and he gets only the toe end on this. Ends up skying it","Short and quick, chest-high, Batter is off his toes to try to cut this down, but it gets big on him, and the top edge flies to third man. This wicket might be worth 10 runs in the end","Batter has been placing these perfectly all night but has found the man at long leg now. Short of a length, into the body, uses his wrists to punch this in the air, but straight to the fielder","Bouncer at 140ks, head high, and batter is under pressure to go after it. It is so hard to control them from this height. Caught at deep midwicket. Bowler too good"," Looks like a juicy full toss, but it dips down on him in the last third of its journey, and he ends up mis-hitting straight down the lap of deep square leg","A smart catch by the fielder at midwicket. Not for the first time the batter has fallen to a short ball. He looks to pull this but gets a massive top edge. Fielder has to back-pedal, which he does, and gets to the right of the ball. So he is catching this over his shoulder and on his natural side. Well done. This is a short ball that has got big on him as his weight is still forward when pulling","Appeal for stumping as he looks to go over extra again but the bowler shortens the length and gives it time to turn past his bat. The batter has only just left the crease, which means he has the time to get back in, especially since the wicket keeper doesn't deal in Dhoni-like no-give stumpings. But his back foot is in the air when he breaks the wicket","Taken at deep midwicket. Overpitched on a middle stump line, there for the slog. But he's gotten too far under this, off the toe-end of the bat and taken on the line","Big appeal for catch behind. Umpire has signaled wide. Captain takes the review. It's a full ball dipping away wide outside off. He reaches out and looks for the drive through point. On early viewing, the bat has definitely hit the ground. But there is a tiny spike on Ultra Edge as the ball goes past bat before that. The bat hits the ground a few frames after that. The third umpire has gone on the evidence of sound and overturned the decision","Yorker into the base of off stump. Sum up a bowler in one line. Seam upright and past Batter's attempted drive through the off side","Swiped straight to deep midwicket. Full ball outside off, half a stride out for the slog and he's not close enough to generate power on it. It's off the inside half and floats out to the fielder","Taken at extra cover. Slower ball dug in short and wide outside off. He checks himself on the lofted cut. Ends up dabbing it for the fielder running back.","Lbw appeal given. Two sounds on it. The batter runs the timer out and decides not to review. It's a quick googly outside off; he's on the front foot for the block. He's beaten on the inside edge and is right in front of off and middle. No question on the line there. And seemingly no edge on that","Clips off stump first ball! Good length, a slider starting from just outside off stump. It's a regulation legbreak. Batter backs away and looks to drive through the covers with all stumps exposed. It marginally gets the outside edge of the off stump","Slapped straight to mid-off! Good length and sliding into middle stump. He backs away to make room and meets this on the up with an angled bat. Possibly looking to go over mid-off but he gets no elevation. Straight into the fielder's lap","Looks to clear mid-off again, but the bowler's adjusted his length. Slams it into a length just outside off. The batter backs away for another loft, but that keeps getting big on him and he can only end up lofting it like they do at catching practice. Mid-off takes it easily. ","Taken at extra cover. Slows it way down this time, The Bowler, and manages to find some grip and turn. The batter looking to hit this full leg-stump ball with the angle, into the leg side. Ends up slicing it as it turns away and it's an easy catch. Top bowling that to end one of the best knocks of the season"]
